       <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Twirl! Spin! Twirl! That's what Amber loved to do more than anything else. When she put on
        her pink ballerina outfit, she twirled and twirled and spun about in circles. When she wasn't practicing her ballet,
        she was out in the woods, playing with the animals.</p>

       <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">The mice, the squirrels, the foxes, the deer, the birds, the hedgehogs, and even the insects loved it when Amber
        came to play. She'd usually find a place to sit in the soft grass and the animals would gather around her. "When are
        you going to dance for us?" Marshmallow, the mouse, asked.</p>

       <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">We want to see you twirling and spinning," said Rupert, the fox.</p>

       <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"My mum doesn't think I'm old enough to perform yet. I'm only six," she smiled. She started petting Jasmine,
        the squirrel. "She said I might be able to dance for her tonight. One day, I'll do it for you," she told them.</p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"Dance for us now," a robin whistled. "Dance for us now, right here, in the woods," it pleaded.</p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">I don't have my ballerina outfit on. Why don't I just tell you a story," she said, changing the subject. The animals
       gathered around and listened as she told them about the delicious food her mum was baking. "My mum gets up every morning and bakes
       bread. Oh, it smells so good. She makes me porridge, or fried eggs and sausages with toast. Sometimes she bakes raisin biscuits and scones."
       Amber reached into her pocket. "I've brought some for you all," she laughed.</p> 

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"Goodie," chuckled Marshmallow, "raisin biscuits for us." She danced around with glee.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Amber broke the biscuits into little bits and tossed them on the grass. "There. That's enough for you all to
      have some," she said, wiping the crumbs off her hands. "My mum cooks big pots of stew, with chunks of beefs, onions, potato,
      turnip, leeks and carrots. They are smothered with thick, brown gravy that is delicious. I couldn't bring you any of that," she giggled.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"That would mess up your pockets," Rupert said.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"Yes, it would make a big mess," Amber laughed. "Sometimes she makes blueberry pie and pours cream on it.
      Sometimes I get to help her, but my favorite thing of all to eat is shortbread. It's creamy and sweet, buttery, and sometimes sprinkled
      with caster sugar. I've got some in my pocket for you," she laughed again, knowing the animals would be happy. She pulled out
      a brown paper bag, opened it and poured the bits of shortbread into her lap. She then broke it into little pieces and tossed it on
      the grass. "Mum says this is old and gave it to me to feed it to animal friends."</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"I love shortbread," said the deer.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"Me too," squeaked Spike, the hedgehog.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">When the animals were finished eating their shortbread, Amber jumped up. "It's time for me to go home now. Mum said I might
      be able to perform for some of the neighbors tonight. I'll come back tomorrow. Cheerio," she called and ran off.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">At home, her mum was waiting for her. A freshly baked rhubarb pie sat on the window ledge. "Mum, you baked a pie. Is it
      for me? Rhubarb is my favourite," Amber said.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"I've got a wee surprise for you, Amber. I've invited Mrs. McGregor and Mr. and Mrs. Baird over to watch you
      dance. I baked the pie to serve them," her mum replied.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"I can dance? Thank you, Mum. I'm going to change into my ballerina outfit right now," Amber giggled and ran off
      to her bedroom.</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Soon the guest arrived. Since it was summertime, which meant longer daylight hours, chairs were set up in the
      back garden. When Amber came outside, Mrs. McGregor, Mr. and Mrs. Baird and, of course, Amber's mum, all began to clap. Amber was
      and so proud. "Doesn't she look lovely tonight," Mrs. McGregor said. "Her golden hair and wee, black, ballet shoes just add to
      the pink, frilly costume." She patted Amber's mum's hand.</p>

     style="width:30%">
     </center>
    
     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">The music began and Amber started to twirl and spin all around. As she danced, she spotted her animal friends.
      They'd come to watch. The squirrels and the birds were in the tree. The deer hid behind the bushes. The butterflies and ladybugs
      sat on a branch of purple heather. The fox and hedgehog sat on the grass along with the wee mice. She felt so happy that they had
      come to watch her perform. When she finished, she bowed. She waved hello to the animals. Everyone clapped, including her animal
      friends. Amber had never felt happier in her life.</p>

    <p class="w3-large w3-mobile"><b>Morals of the story:-<br>
     1. Always believe in yourself.<br>
     2. A little bit of kindness made people's day.<br>
     3. Friends always be there for each other.<br></p>
