    <img src="img/goldilocks.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:20%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">One day, a little girl named Goldilocks was playing near the forest.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She saw a pretty little cottage at a distance, and wondered, "What a lovely cottage! I wonder 
	 who lives here?".</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She decided to visit it.</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks1.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:18%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks peeped in through the window.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"Anybody there?" she asked.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Nobody answered.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The room had toys and books.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks was curious to see more.</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks2.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:20%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The main door was not locked.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks went inside.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She saw a dining table laid out with food.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks was hungry.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">'I don't think they will mind if I eat a little,' she tought.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks tasted the porridge from the biggest bowl first.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">It was too hot.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Then she tasted from the second bowl.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">It was too cold.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">But when she tasted from the third, the smallest bowl, the porridge was just right.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks ate it all up!</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks3.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:20%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks felt tired.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She sat on a large chair.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">It was too hard and too uncomfortable.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Then she sast on a medium - sized chair, but it was too soft and too comfortable.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She then saw a small chair and thought, 'This chair looks just perfect for me!' and sat 
	 on it.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">CRRACK! The little chair broke!</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">It was too delicate!</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks4.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:20%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks was feeling sleepy by now.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"I should rest for a while," she said to herself.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">So, she went upstairs into the bedroom.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She saw three beds of different sizes.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">'Let me see which bed is the most comfortable,' she tought.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">At first, Goldilocks sat on the biggest bed, but it was too hard.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Then, she sat on the medium - sized one.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">But it was too soft.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Finally, she sat on the third bed, which was the smallest of all.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"This bed is just right!" she said happily, as she rested on it.</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks5.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:22%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The cottage belonged to three bears, Papa bear, Mama bear and Baby bear who had gone out 
	 for a walk.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">They returned hungry and sat down for breakfast.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">But they were in for a suprise!</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"Who has tasted my porridge?' growled Papa bear.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Mama bear exclaimed, "Someone has tasted my porridge too!" "BOO HOO "Someone has eaten 
	 up my porridge!" cried Baby bear.</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks6.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:22%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Papa bear and Mama bear were surprised to see this.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"Someone has been in our house while we were away," said Papa bear, thoughtfully.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The bear family looked around but found no one.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"Someone has broken my chair!" Baby bear cried out loud from the living room.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"Let us look upstairs too," suggested Mama bear.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">They went up to their bedroom.</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks7.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:22%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Finding his bed a little untidy, Papa bear growled, "Somebody has sat on my bed!"</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The next moment, Mama bear exclaimed, "well, someone has been on my bed too!"</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Baby bear cried out, "Somebody is still sleeping on my bed!"</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Mama bear and Papa bear quickly went towards Baby bear's bed and saw Goldilocks fast 
	 asleep</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The three bears stood around the bed.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">"So, this is the little girl who has eaten our porridge and broken our chair!" exclaimed 
	 Papa bear.</p>
	<img src="img/goldilocks8.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge" alt="Goldilocks" style="width:22%">
     <br>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Just then, Goldilocks woke up and saw the three bears looking down at her</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She was frightened indeed!</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">The next moment, she jumped out of the bed, and ran out of the cottage.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">Goldilocks did not stop running till she reached her home.</p>
	 <p class="w3-xxlarge">She promised herself, never to enter anyone's house uninvited!</p>
