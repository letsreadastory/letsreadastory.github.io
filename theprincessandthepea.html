    <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">There was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she must be a real Princess. He travelled
     all over the world in hopes of finding such a lady; but there was always something wrong.</p>

    <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Princesses he found in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible for him to decide,
     for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not quite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite cast down,
     because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his wife.</p>

    <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">One evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the rain poured down from the sky in
     torrents: beside, it was as dark as pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and the old King, the Prince's
     father, went out himself to open it.</p>

    <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">It was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain and the wind, she was in a sad
     condition; the water trickled down from her hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real Princess.</p>

    <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">"Ah! we shall soon see that!" thought the old Queen-mother; however, she said not a word of what
     she was going to do; but went quietly into the bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas on
     the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over the three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.</p>

   <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Upon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.</p>

   <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">The next morning she was asked how she had slept. "Oh, very badly indeed!" she replied.
    "I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night through. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard
     under me, and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!"</p>

        style="width:30%">
     </center>

   <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Now it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had been able to feel the three little peas
    through the twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a delicate sense of
    feeling.</p>

   <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">The Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he had found a real Princess. 
    The three peas were however put into the cabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they are not lost.</p>

   <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">Wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?</p>

     <p class="w3-large w3-mobile"><b>Morals of the story:-<br>
      1. Little things can make a big difference.<br>
      2. Be happy with the comforts you have.<br>
      3. A status of a person doesn't makes them different than others.<br></p>
