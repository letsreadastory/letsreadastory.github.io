     <br>
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">When she was very young, her mother died of an illness.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Later, her father married a widow with two daughters.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Thus, Cinderella had a stepmother and two stepsisters.</p>
	<img src="img/cinderella.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile " alt="Cinderella" style="width:30%">
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">One day, poor cinderella's father passed away too.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">From that day onwards, her stepmother became very cruel to her.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">She made Cinderella do all the household work.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The stepmother and stepsisters did not do anything!</p>
	<img src="img/cinderella1.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile" alt="Cinderella" style="width:20%">
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">One day, the King decided to hold a ball for his son.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">His son will choose a bride for himself there.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The invitation for the ball were sent out to all the unmaried girls including the 
	  stepsisters.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">They were very excited.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Cinderella also was very excited.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">She asked her stepmother, "Can I also go to the ball?"</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Her stepmother then gave her a very mean look and said ,"No! how can you even think
      of going there?</p>
    <img src="img/cinderella2.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile" alt="Cinderella" style="width:30%">
     <br>
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">When her stepmother and stepsisters left to the King's Palace, Cinderella felt very sad 
	  and cried alone in the hause.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Suddenly, there was a flash of light and a woman appeared.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">She said, "I am your Fairy Godmather. I come to make your wish come true. You will go to 
	  the Ball my dear."</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Cinderella feel very happy to hear this.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The Fairy Godmother waved her magic wand, then suddenly there appeared a beautiful party 
	  dress and a pair of glass slippers!</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The Fairy Godmother also turned a pumpkin into a carriage and two mice into horses!</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">However, the Fairy Godmother have warned Cinderella, "Remember to return before midnight."</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Then, Cinderella went to the palace.</p>
	<img src="img/cinderella3.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile" alt="Cinderella" style="width:30%">
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">The prince was greeting his guests when he noticed a beautiful girl in a corner.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">It was Cinderella.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">She looked extremely beautiful.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The Prince could not take his eyes off her and asked her for a dance.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">He danced only with her throughout the Ball.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">For Cinderella, it was a dream come true</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">She had never been so happy in her life.</p> 
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">She almost forgot about the hard times she had with her stepmother and stepsisters.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Suddenly Cinderella realised that it was almost midnight.</p>
	<img src="img/cinderella4.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile" alt="Cinderella" style="width:30%">
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">Time to go girl, she tought.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">So, off she ran to her carriage leaving the Prince in a daze.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The prince rushed after Cinderella but she did not stop.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">One of her glass slippers fell of on the steps before she left in her carriage.</p>
	<img src="img/cinderella5.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile " alt="Cinderella" style="width:30%">
      <p class="w3-xxlarge">The Prince picked the glass slipper.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">He said, "The girl whose foot fits this slipper will be the one I marry."</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The King's attendants were sent to every house.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Many girls tried wearing the slipper but all of the failed.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Her stepsisters eagerly tried the slipper.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">But their feet were too big for the glass slipper!</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">Finally Cinderella tried the glass slipper.</p>
	  <p class="w3-xxlarge">It fitted her foot perfectly</p>
	<img src="img/cinderella7.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge w3-mobile" alt="Cinderella" style="width:30%">
