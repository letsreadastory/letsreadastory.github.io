		<p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center"> Once upon a time, there lived a cloth merchant in a village with his wife and two children.</p> 
		 <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center"> They were indeed quite well-off. They had a beautiful hen which laid an egg every day. It was not an ordinary egg, rather, a golden egg.</p>
		 <p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">But the man was not satisfied with what he used to get daily. He was a get rich-trice kind of a person.</p>	 
		<p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center"> The man wanted to get all the golden eggs from his hen at one single go. So, one day he thought hard and at last clicked upon a plan.</p>
		<p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center">He decided to kill the hen and get all the eggs together.</p>
		 <img src="images/egg1.png" style="width:50%">
		<p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center"> So, the next day when the hen laid a golden egg, the man caught hold of it, took a sharp knife, chopped off its neck and cut its body open. 
		There was nothing but blood all around & no trace of any egg at all. He was highly grieved because now he would not get even one single egg.</p>
		<p class="w3-large w3-mobile w3-center"> His life was going on smoothly with one egg a day but now, he himself made his life miserable. The outcome of his greed was that he started becoming poorer & poorer day by day and ultimately became a pauper. 
		How jinxed and how much foolish he was.</p>
