     <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-mobile w3-center">There once was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to hand him a bag of nails
      and said that every time the boy lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.</p>

     <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-mobile w3-center">On the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence. The boy gradually 
      began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly
      decreased. He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.</p>

       <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_yJ7j-UHP4I/hqdefault.jpg" class="w3-mobile" alt="fence" style="width:30%">
     </center>

    <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-mobile w3-center">Finally, the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his
     father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper
     under control.</p>

   <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-mobile w3-center">The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the
    nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.</p>

   <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-mobile w3-center">"You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will
    never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man
    and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there.</p>

  <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-mobile"><b>Moral of the story:<br>
   Control your anger, and don't say things to people in heat of 
   the moment, that you may later regret. Some things in life, you are unable to take back.</p>
